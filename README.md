# switch-case


This README provides comprehensive information and usage guidelines for the Switch Case statement, a fundamental control structure in many programming languages.

Purpose
The Switch Case statement is used to perform different actions based on the value of an expression. It allows you to define multiple code blocks, each associated with a specific value or range of values. This statement is particularly useful when you have a series of conditions to evaluate.

Theory
The Switch Case statement, also known as a switch statement, is a branching construct in programming. It is designed to efficiently evaluate a single expression and, based on its value, select one of several code blocks to execute. This can be considered a multi-branching operation, and it is commonly used for simplifying complex decision-making in code.

The switch statement works by comparing the value of the expression against a series of predefined cases. When a case matches the expression's value, the corresponding code block is executed. If no cases match, an optional "default" case is executed.

Algorithm
The general algorithm for a Switch Case statement is as follows:

Evaluate the expression provided in the switch statement.
Compare the result of the expression to the values defined in the case statements.
If a case value matches the expression's result, execute the associated code block and exit the switch statement using the break statement.
If no case values match the expression, execute the code in the default case, if it is provided.
The switch statement terminates.
